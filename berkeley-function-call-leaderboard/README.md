## Introduction
We present Berkeley Function Leaderboard, the **first comprehensive and executable function calling evaluation for LLMs function calling**. Different from prior function calling evaluations (e.g. Anyscale function calling blog), we consider function callings of various forms, different function calling scenarios, and the executability of function calls. We also release our model Gorilla-Openfunctions-v2, the best open-source models so far to handle multiple languages of function calls, parallel function calls and multiple function calls. We also provide a specific debugging feature that when the provided function is not suitable for your task, the model will output an “Error Message”. 

Read more about the technical details and interesting insights in our blog post!

### Install Dependencies

Before generating the leaderboard statistics, you should install dependencies using the following command: 

```bash
    conda create -n BFCL python=3.10
    conda activate BFCL
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Inside ./berkeley-function-call-leaderboard
    pip install vllm # If you have vLLM supported GPU(s) and want to run our evaluation data against self-hosted OSS models.
```
If you plan to evaluate on OSS models, we are using vLLM for inference and refer to https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm for detail. We recommend to inference on at least V100s, A100s, and latest GPUs that are supported by vLLM. 

### Checker Setup (required for Java, JavaScript test categories)
We use `tree-sitter` to do the AST parsing for Java and JavaScript test categories. Thus, you need to install `tree-sitter`.

The git clones need to be under the `./berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/eval_checker` folder.

```bash
cd ./berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/eval_checker
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java.git
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-javascript.git
```

Now, move back to `./berkeley-function-call-leaderboard` by `cd ..`, and create two symbolic links to the `tree-sitter-java` and `tree-sitter-javascript` directories. This is required to run `openfunctions_evaluation.py`.

```
ln -s eval_checker/tree-sitter-java tree-sitter-java
ln -s eval_checker/tree-sitter-javascript tree-sitter-javascript
```

## Prepare Evaluation Dataset

To download the evaluation dataset from huggingface, from the current directory `./berkeley-function-call-leaderboard`, run the following command:

```bash
    huggingface-cli download gorilla-llm/Berkeley-Function-Calling-Leaderboard --local-dir ./data --repo-type dataset
```


This will download our dataset to `data` repository. 

## Evaluation Dataset

The evaluation datasets are now stored in the `./data` folder. The possible answers are stored in the `./data/possible_answer` folder. 


## Execution Evaluation Data Post-processing 
Input your API keys into `function_credential_config.json`, so that the original placeholder values in questions, params, and answers will be cleaned. 

To run the executable test categories, there are 4 API keys to fill out:

1. RAPID-API Key: https://rapidapi.com/hub

    * Yahoo Finance: https://rapidapi.com/sparior/api/yahoo-finance15
    * Real Time Amazon Data : https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-amazon-data
    * Urban Dictionary: https://rapidapi.com/community/api/urban-dictionary
    * Covid 19: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193
    * Time zone by Location: https://rapidapi.com/BertoldVdb/api/timezone-by-location

    All the Rapid APIs we use have free tier usage. As a result, you need to subscribe to those API providers in order to have the executable test environment setup but it will be free of charge!

2. Exchange Rate API:https://www.exchangerate-api.com
3. OMDB API: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
4. Geocode API: https://geocode.maps.co/

The `apply_function_credential_config.py` inputs an input file, optionally an outputs file. If the output file is not given as an argument, it will overwrites your original file with the cleaned data.

```bash
    python apply_function_credential_config.py --input_file ./data/gorilla_openfunctions_v1_test_rest.json
```

Then, use `eval_data_compilation.py` to compile all files by using

```bash
    python eval_data_compilation.py
```
## Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard Statistics

To run Mistral Models function calling, you need to have `mistralai >= 0.1.3`.

Also provide your API keys in your environment variables.

```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXX
    export MISTRAL_API_KEY=XXXXXX
    export FIRE_WORKS_API_KEY=XXXXXX
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=XXXXXX
```

To generate leaderboard statistics, there are two steps:

1. Inference the evaluation data and obtain the results from specific models 

```bash
    python openfunctions_evaluation.py --model MODEL_NAME --test_category TEST_CATEGORY
```
For TEST_CATEGORY, we have `executable_simple`, `executable_parallel_function`, `executable_multiple_function`, `executable_parallel_multiple_function`, `simple`, `relevance`, `parallel_function`, `multiple_function`, `parallel_multiple_function`, `java`, `javascript`, `rest`, `sql`, `chatable`.

If you want to run all evaluation at the same time, you can use `all` as the test category.

Running proprietary model like GPTs, Claude, Mistral-X will requires an API-Key which can be supplied in `openfunctions_evaluation.py`.

If decided to run OSS model, openfunctions evaluation uses vllm and therefore requires GPU for hosting and inferencing. If you have questions or concerns about evaluating OSS models, please reach out to us in our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/grXXvj9Whz).




## Checking the Evaluation Results

### Running the Checker

Navigate to the `./berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/eval_checker` directory and run the `eval_runner.py` script with the desired parameters. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
    python ./eval_runner.py --model MODEL_NAME --test_category {TEST_CATEGORY,all,ast,executable,python,non-python}
```

- `MODEL_NAME`: Optional. The name of the model you wish to evaluate. This parameter can accept multiple model names separated by spaces. Eg, `--model gorilla-openfunctions-v2 gpt-4-0125-preview`.
    - If no model name is provided, the script will run the checker on all models exist in the `./result` folder. This path can be changed by modifying the `INPUT_PATH` variable in the `eval_runner.py` script.
- `TEST_CATEGORY`: Optional. The category of tests to run. You can specify multiple categories separated by spaces. Available options include:
    - `all`: Run all test categories.
    - `ast`: Abstract Syntax Tree tests.
    - `executable`: Executable code evaluation tests.
    - `python`: Tests specific to Python code.
    - `non-python`: Tests for code in languages other than Python, such as Java and JavaScript.
    - Individual test categories:
        - `simple`: Simple function calls.
        - `parallel_function`: Multiple function calls in parallel.
        - `multiple_function`: Multiple function calls in sequence.
        - `parallel_multiple_function`: Multiple function calls in parallel and in sequence.
        - `executable_simple`: Executable function calls.
        - `executable_parallel_function`: Executable multiple function calls in parallel.
        - `executable_multiple_function`: Executable multiple function calls in sequence.
        - `executable_parallel_multiple_function`: Executable multiple function calls in parallel and in sequence.
        - `java`: Java function calls.
        - `javascript`: JavaScript function calls.
        - `rest`: REST API function calls.
        - `relevance`: Function calls with irrelevant function documentation.
    - If no test category is provided, the script will run all available test categories.
> If you want to run the `all` or `executable` or `python` category, make sure to register your REST API keys in `function_credential_config.json`. This is because Gorilla Openfunctions Leaderboard wants to test model's generated output on real world API! 
> If you do not wish to provide API keys for REST API testing, set `test_category` to `ast` or any non-executable category.

### Example Usage

If you want to run all tests for the `gorilla-openfunctions-v2` model, you can use the following command:

```bash
    python ./eval_runner.py --model gorilla-openfunctions-v2
```

If you want to runn `rest` tests for all GPT models, you can use the following command:

```bash
    python ./eval_runner.py --model gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 gpt-4-0613 gpt-4-1106-preview gpt-4-0125-preview --test_category rest
```

If you want to run `rest` and `javascript` tests for all GPT models and `gorilla-openfunctions-v2`, you can use the following command:

```bash
    python ./eval_runner.py --model gorilla-openfunctions-v2 gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 gpt-4-0613 gpt-4-1106-preview gpt-4-0125-preview --test_category rest javascript
```


## Models Available
Below is *a table of model we support* to run our leaderboard evaluation against. If supported function calling (FC), we will follow its function calling format provided by official documentations. Else, we will construct system message to prompt the model to generate function calls in the right format.
|Model | Type |
|---|---|
|gorilla-openfunctions-v2 | Function Calling|
|gpt-3.5-turbo-0125-FC| Function Calling|
|gpt-3.5-turbo-0125| Prompt|
|gpt-4-{0613,1106-preview,0125-preview}-FC| Function Calling|
|gpt-4-{0613,1106-preview,0125-preview}|Prompt|
|glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v1 💻|  Function Calling| 
|Nexusflow-Raven-v2 | Function Calling|
|fire-function-v1-FC | Function Calling|
|mistral-large-2402-FC-{Any,Auto} | Function Calling|
|mistral-large-2402 | Prompt|
|mistral-medium-2312 | Prompt|
|mistral-small-2402-FC-{Any,Auto} | Function Calling|
|mistral-small-2402 | Prompt|
|mistral-tiny-2312 | Prompt|
|claude-3-{opus,sonnet}-20240229-FC | Function Calling |
|claude-3-haiku-20240307-FC | Function Calling |
|claude-3-{opus,sonnet}-20240229 | Prompt |
|claude-{2.1,instant-1.2}| Prompt|
|gemini-1.0-pro | Function Calling|
|databrick-dbrx-instruct | Prompt|
|google/gemma-7b-it 💻| Prompt|
|deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct 💻| Prompt|
|meetkai_functionary-{small,medium}-v2.4-FC| Function Calling|
|meetkai_functionary-small-v2.2-FC| Function Calling|

Here {MODEL} 💻 means the model needs to be hosted locally and called by vllm, {MODEL} means the models that are called API calls. For models with a trailing `-FC`, it means that the model supports function calling feature. You can check out the table summarizing feature supports among different models [here](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/8_berkeley_function_calling_leaderboard.html#prompt).


For model names with {.}, it means that the model has multiple versions. For example, we provide evaluation on three versions of GPT-4: `gpt-4-0125-preview`, `gpt-4-1106-preview`, and `gpt-4-0613`.

For Mistral large and small models, we provide evaluation on both of there `Any` and `Auto` settings. More information about this can be found in [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/function-calling/).


For inferencing `Gemini-1.0-pro`, you need to fill in `model_handler/gemini_handler.py` with your GCP project ID that has access to Vertex AI endpoint.
For inferencing `Databrick-DBRX-instruct`, you need to create a Databrick Azure workspace and setup an endpoint for inference. 


## Changelog
* [April 8, 2024] [#330](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/330): Fixed an oversight that was introduced in [#299](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/299). For function-calling (FC) models that cannot take `float` type in input, when the parameter type is a `float`, the evaluation procedure will convert that type to `number` in the model input and mention in the parameter description that `This is a float type value.`. An additional field `format: float` will also be included in the model input to make it clear about the type. Updated the model handler for Claude, Mistral, and OSS to better parse the model output.
* [April 3, 2024] [#309](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/309): Bug fix for evaluation dataset possible answers. Implement **string standardization** for the AST evaluation pipeline, i.e. removing white spaces and a subset of punctuations (`,./-_*^`) to make the AST evaluation more robust and accurate. Fixed AST evaluation issue for type `tuple`. Add 2 new models `meetkai/functionary-small-v2.4 (FC)`, `meetkai/functionary-medium-v2.4 (FC)` to the leaderboard.
* [April 1, 2024] [#299](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/299): Leaderboard update with new models (`Claude-3-Haiku`, `Databrick-DBRX-Instruct`), more advanced AST evaluation procedure, and updated evaluation datasets. Cost and latency statistics during evaluation are also measured. We also released the manual that our evaluation procedure is based on, available [here](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/8_berkeley_function_calling_leaderboard.html#metrics).
* [Mar 11, 2024] [#254](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/254): Leaderboard update with 3 new models: `Claude-3-Opus-20240229 (Prompt)`, `Claude-3-Sonnet-20240229 (Prompt)`, and `meetkai/functionary-medium-v2.2 (FC)`
* [Mar 5, 2024] [#237](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/237) and [238](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/238): leaderboard update resulting from [#223](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/223); 3 new models: `mistral-large-2402`, `gemini-1.0-pro`, and `gemma`.
* [Feb 29, 2024] [#223](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/223): modifications to REST evaluation. 


## Contributing

To add new model to the Function Calling Leaderboard, here are a few things you need to do:

1. Take a look at the `model_handler/handler.py`. This is the base handler object where all handlers are inherited from 
2. Create your handler and define the following functions 
    1. `__init__`: on initialization, you need to create a `self.client` object if you have an existing endpoint(e.g. `self.client = OpenAI()`) or follow `model_handler/oss_handler.py` for starting a vLLM serving.
    2. `inference`: inference function takes in prompt, functions, as well as a optional programming language parameters. It will make call to the endpoint, compile result in desired format, as well as logging the token number and latency
    3. `decode_ast`: decode_ast will convert the response from raw output in the format of `[{func1:{param1:val1,...}},{func2:{param2:val2,...}}] This format will be used to check for exact matching the parameters.
    4. `decode_execute`: deocde_execute will convert the response from raw output in the format of `"[func1(param1=val1),func2(param2=val2)]"`
3. Modify `model_handler/handler_map.py`. This mapping contains key as the exact model name and value as the handler object of the specific model. 
4. If your model is price based, please update the pricing detail, i.e. price per million tokens under `eval_runner_helper.py`
5. Raise a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pulls) with your new Model Handler. We will run the model handler if an endpoint is established. If self-hosting is required and the model size is large, we might not be able to accommodate model hosting therefore an OpenAI compatible endpoint for evaluation is desired. 
6. Feel Free to join [Gorilla Discord](https://discord.gg/grXXvj9Whz) `#leaderboard` and reach out to us for any questions or concerns in adding new models. We are happy to help you!
